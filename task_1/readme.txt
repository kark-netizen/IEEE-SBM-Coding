hey 'program reader'!

all these programms have been made to the best of my knowledge on c++ and are in working condition.
In case of any error while running on your machine(quite a common occurence on codechef) OR 
in case I have missed some critical corner cases OR i have an inherently flawed logic, I would 
highly appreciate a ping on whatsapp or email to let me know, provided you have time to do so, of course.

Happy Testing!
Have a great day!
